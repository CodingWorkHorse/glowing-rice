        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Double Chocolate</strong></h3>
      <p style="padding: 5px;">While the origins of the word chocolate is unknown, it most likely comes from the Spanish who in turn most likely took it from the Mayan word "chocol" meaning hot, and the Aztec word "atl" meaning water. They most likely chose this word instead of the Aztec word "cacahuatl" as caca is a vulgar in Spanish. <br><br>
â€‹
Chocolate has been around for almost 4 thousand years. First used by the ancient Mesoamerican people, chocolate has a rich and amazing history. The Ancient Mayan made a type of hot chocolate by mixing cacao seeds, water and chili peppers. Made by heating the ingredients together and than pouring from cup to cup until it became frothy, their chocolate drink became known as the food of the gods. When the Aztecs conquered the Mayans, they became so infatuated with it, that chocolate was used as currency. The Aztecs loved the Mayan drink, and it became an incredibly rare and precious item. The king of the Aztecs loved it so much that he had 50 glasses of it a day. It was so rare that counterfeit cocoa beans became common. When the Spanish arrived, Herman Cortes Brought chocolate back, enjoying its amazing taste. When the King and queen of Europe tasted it, they fell in love with it, and chocolate soon spread across Europe, and into gelato.<br><br>


We care about producing only the best gelato we can. Created only with the the most quality chocolate, we hand pack each and every pint to make sure that it is of the best of quality. Unlike other brands, we also ensure that each and every pint is as chocolaty as can be, and that is why it is called double chocolate, because it has twice the chocolate of other brands. We are proud of our delicious flavor, Double Chocolate and are positive, that you will enjoy eating it as much as we enjoy making it</p>

      <p style="padding: 5px;">The word mint comes from the latin word mentha which in turn came from the name of the Greek nymph Minthe, who according to the myth was turned into the mint plant after trying to seduce Hades, one of the most important Greek gods. Mint has always been an important plant, and has a long history to it. Originally used as an aid to chest and stomach pains, mint was used by the Greeks in there baths to help stimulate there bodies. It was than used by the Romans in their sauces, and as a mouth wash. The monks of old, also used mint for its many culinary properties. Mint is still very widely used, and is a favorite herb of many.<br><br>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Madagascar Vanilla</strong></h3>
      <p style="padding: 5px;">The word Vanilla coming from the Spanish word "vaina" meaning pod, has been enjoyed for hundreds of years. First enjoyed by the Totonacs of Eastern Mexico, and than by the Aztecs, which took them over, Vanilla has always been a treat to enjoy. The Aztecs enjoyed it in their drink "Chocolatl" Which was mostly chocolate, but with added vanilla for even more taste. When Vanilla, got over to Europe later, it was instantly enjoyed there too. Vanilla though, didn't truly separate from chocolate until the 17th century, when the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth 1st, ordered an all vanilla sweetener, when she tried it she fell in love, and within the next century it spread all over Europe, and quickly became a classic gelato flavor.
